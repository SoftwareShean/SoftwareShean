### Hi, I'm Shean! 

I'm a software engineer in Brooklyn. 

I love React, Ruby, MongoDB, and SQL. 

Feel free to peak around my code or [visit my website](http://sheanj.com/).

Currently I am:
- Refactoring [COVIDATA](http://github.com/sheanj/COVIDATA/) to the React Framework and adding data visualization functionality to the app
- Refactoring [Plantology](http://github.com/sheanj/Plantology/) to include a Rails backend with a userbase 
- Adding functionality to [CURA](http://github.com/sheanj/CURA) that will allow for user uploaded images via AWS S3 Bucket, as well as widgets and user customization

If you're looking for a dedicated and passionate full-stack software engineer please get in touch!
